# IconMaker

Welcome to IconMaker, the icon creation app! With IconMaker, you can create custom icons from pre-defined HTML codes and using hexadecimal colors. It’s easy and quick to use, and you can create unique icons for your projects in a matter of minutes.

When using IconMaker, a folder called “ImageRepo” will be automatically created in the same repository where the app is located. This folder is used to store all the images created by the app, so you can easily access them whenever you need.

Try it out now and start creating your own custom icons!
